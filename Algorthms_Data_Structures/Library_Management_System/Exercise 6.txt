Time Complexity:
  Best Case: ( O(1)) (when the target element is the first element in the list)
  Average Case: ( O(n) )
  Worst Case: ( O(n) ) (when the target element is the last element or not present in the list)


 Binary Search
 Time Complexity:
  Best Case: ( O(1) ) (when the target element is the middle element of the list)
  Average Case: ( O(log n) )
  Worst Case: ( O(log n) )


 When to Use Each Algorithm

 Linear Search

When to Use:
  1. Unsorted Data: Use linear search when the data is not sorted. Linear search does not depend on the order of elements and simply checks each element one by one.
  2. Small Data Sets: For small datasets, the overhead of sorting the data before performing a binary search might outweigh the benefits. Linear search is simple and effective for small lists.
  
 Binary Search

- When to Use:
  1. Sorted Data: Binary search is only applicable to sorted lists. The list must be sorted before performing a binary search to ensure the search is efficient.
  2. Large Data Sets: For large datasets, the logarithmic time complexity \( O(\log n) \) makes binary search much faster than linear search, which is \( O(n) \).
  3. Frequent Searches: When the list is large, and searches are frequent, the efficiency of binary search significantly reduces the overall time complexity.
