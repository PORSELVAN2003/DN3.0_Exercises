1. Base Case: 
   Time Complexity: ( O(1) )
   Description: The base case is the condition under which the recursion stops. It is 
2. Recursive Case:
   -Time Complexity: Depends on the number of recursive calls and the amount of work done at each call.
   - For example, in a recursive function that divides the problem into two smaller problems of roughly equal size, the time complexity can often be expressed using the recurrence relation:
     
     T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)
     
     where:
      ( a ) is the number of recursive calls.
      ( \frac{n}{b} ) is the size of each subproblem.
      ( f(n) ) represents the work done outside the recursive calls.



To optimize recursive solutions and avoid excessive computation, consider the following techniques:

1. Memoization:
    Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
   
   Time Complexity: Reduces to ( O(n) ) due to the reuse of previously computed values.

2. Dynamic Programming (DP):
    Solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
     

   Time Complexity: ( O(n) ) with ( O(n) ) space complexity.

3. Tail Recursion Optimization:
    Transform a recursive function into a tail-recursive function, where the recursive call is the last operation in the function.
     
   Time Complexity: ( O(n) ), and it may be optimized to use constant space.

4. Iterative Approach*:
   Convert the recursive solution to an iterative one, using loops and explicit stack management.
   
   Time Complexity: ( O(n) ) with ( O(1) ) space complexity.
